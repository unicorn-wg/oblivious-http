Abstract

   This document describes a system for the forwarding of encrypted HTTP
   messages.  This allows clients to make requests of servers without
   the server being able to link requests to other requests from the
   same client.

1.  Introduction

   Words...

   This document describes a method of encapsulation for binary HTTP
   messages [BINARY] using Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE; [HPKE]).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Encapsulated Request:  An HTTP request that is encapsulated in an
      HPKE-encrypted message; see Section 4.1.

   Encapsulated Response:  An HTTP response that is encapsulated in an
      HPKE-encrypted message; see Section 4.2.

   Oblivious Proxy Resource:  An intermediary that forwards requests and
      responses between clients and a single oblivious request resource.

   Oblivious Request Resource:  A resource that can receive an
      encapsulated request, extract the contents of that request,
      forward it to an oblivious target resource, receive a response,
      encapsulate that response, then return that response.

   Oblivious Target Resource:  The resource that is the target of an
      encapsulated request.  This resource logically handles only
      regular HTTP requests and responses and so might be ignorant of
      the use of oblivious HTTP to reach it.

   This draft includes pseudocode that uses the functions and
   conventions defined in [HPKE].

   This draft uses the variable-length integer encoding from Section 16
   of [QUIC].  Encoding and decoding variable-length integers to a
   sequence of bytes are described using the functions "vencode()" and
   "vdecode()".  The function "len()" takes the length of a sequence of
   bytes.

   Formats are described using notation from Section 1.3 of [QUIC].

3.  Overview

   A client learns the following:

   *  The identity of an oblivious request resource.  This might include
      some information about oblivious target resources that the
      oblivious request resource supports.

   *  The details of an HPKE public key that the oblivious request
      resource accepts, including an identifier for that key and the
      HPKE algorithms that are used with that key.

   *  The identity of an oblivious proxy resource that will forward
      encapsulated requests and responses to the oblivious request
      resource.

   This information allows the client to make a request of an oblivious
   target resource without that resource having only a limited ability
   to correlate that request with the client IP or other requests that
   the client might make to that server.

                    Figure 1: Overview of Oblivious HTTP

   In order to make a request to an oblivious target resource, the
   following steps occur, as shown in Figure 1:

   1.   The client constructs an HTTP request for an oblivious target
        resource.

   2.   The client encodes the HTTP request in a binary HTTP message and
        then encapsulates that message using HPKE and the process from
        Section 4.1.

   3.   The client sends a POST request to the oblivious proxy resource
        with the encapsulated request as the content of that message.

   4.   The oblivious proxy resource forwards this request to the
        oblivious request resource.

   5.   The oblivious request resource receives this request and removes
        the HPKE protection to obtain an HTTP request.

   6.   The oblivious request resource makes an HTTP request that
        includes the target URI, method, fields, and content of the
        request it acquires.

   7.   The oblivious target resource answers this HTTP request with an
        HTTP response.

   8.   The oblivious request resource encapsulates the HTTP response
        following the process in Section 4.2 and sends this in response
        to the request from the oblivious proxy resource.

   9.   The oblivious proxy resource forwards this response to the
        client.

   10.  The client removes the encapsulation to obtain the response to
        the original request.

4.  HPKE Encapsulation

   HTTP message encapsulation uses HPKE for request and response
   encryption.  An encapsulated HTTP message includes the following
   values:

   1.  A binary-encoded HTTP message; see [BINARY].

   2.  Padding of arbitrary length which MUST contain all zeroes.

   The encoding of an HTTP message is as follows:

   Plaintext Message {
     Message Length (i),
     Message (..),
     Padding Length (i),
     Padding (..),
   }

   An Encapsulated Request is comprised of a length-prefixed key
   identifier and a HPKE-protected request message.  HPKE protection
   includes an encapsulated KEM shared secret (or "enc"), plus the AEAD-
   protected request message.  An Encapsulated Request is shown in
   Figure 2.  Section 4.1 describes the process for constructing and
   processing an Encapsulated Request.

   Key Identifer {
     Key ID Length (i),
     Key ID (..),
   }

   Encapsulated Request {
     Key Identifier (..),
     Encapsulated KEM Shared Secret (..),
     AEAD-Protected Request (..),
   }

                       Figure 2: Encapsulated Request

   Responses are bound to responses and so consist only of AEAD-
   protected content.  Section 4.2 describes the process for
   constructing and processing an Encapsulated Response.

   Encapsulated Response {
     Nonce (Nk),
     AEAD-Protected Response (..),
   }

                      Figure 3: Encapsulated Response

   The size of the Nonce field in an Encapsulated Response corresponds
   to the size of an AEAD key for the corresponding HPKE ciphersuite.

4.1.  HPKE Encapsulation of Requests

   Clients encapsulate a request "request" with an HPKE public key
   "pkR", whose wire-encoded Key Identifier is "keyID" as follows:

   1.  Compute an HPKE context using "pkR", yielding "context" and
       encapsulation key "enc".

   2.  Construct additional associated data, "aad", by prepending a
       single byte with a value of 0x01 to the key identifier.  The key
       identifier length is included in the AAD.

   3.  Encrypt (seal) "request" with "keyID" as associated data using
       "context", yielding ciphertext "ct".

   4.  Concatenate the length of "keyID" as a variable-length integer,
       "keyID", "enc" and "ct", yielding an Encapsulated Request
       "enc_request".  Note that "enc" is of fixed-length, so there is
       no ambiguity in parsing "enc" and "ct".

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

   enc, context = SetupBaseS(pkR, "request")
   ct = context.Seal(keyID, request)
   enc_request = concat(keyID, enc, ct)

   Servers decrypt an Encapsulated Request by reversing this process.
   Given an Encapsulated Request "enc_request", a server:

   1.  Parses "enc_request" into "keyID", "enc", and "ct" (indicated
       using the function "parse()" in pseudocode).  The server is then
       able to find the HPKE private key, "skR", corresponding to
       "keyID".  If no such key exists, the server MUST return an error
       with HTTP status code 401.

   2.  Compute an HPKE context using "skR" and the encapsulated key
       "enc", yielding "context".

   3.  Construct additional associated data, "aad", as the wire-encoded
       Key Identifier "keyID" from "enc_request".

   4.  Decrypt "ct" using "aad" as associated data, yielding "request"
       or an error on failure.  If decryption fails, the server MUST
       return an error with HTTP status code 400.

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

   keyID, enc, ct = parse(enc_request)
   context = SetupBaseR(enc, skR, "request")
   request, error = context.Open(keyID, ct)

   Servers MUST verify that the request padding consists of all zeroes
   before processing the corresponding Message.

4.2.  HPKE Encapsulation of Responses

   Given an HPKE context "context", a request message "request", and a
   response "response", servers generate an Encapsulated Response
   "enc_response" as follows:

   1.  Export a secret "secret" from "context", using the string
       "response" as a label.  The length of this secret is "Nk" - the
       length of an AEAD key assocated with "context".

   2.  Extract a pseudorandom key "prk" using the "Extract" function
       provided by the KDF algorithm associated with "context".  The
       "ikm" input to this function is "secret"; the "salt" input is the
       concatenation of "enc" (from "enc_request") and "Nk" random
       bytes.

   3.  Use the "Expand" function provided by the same KDF to extract an
       AEAD key "key", of length "Nk" - the length of the keys used by
       the AEAD associated with "context".  Generating "key" uses a
       label of "key".

   4.  Use the same "Expand" function to extract a nonce "nonce" of
       length "Nn" - the length of the nonce used by the AEAD.
       Generating "nonce" uses a label of "nonce".

   5.  Encrypt "response", passing the AEAD function Seal the values of
       "key", "nonce", "aad", and a "pt" input of "request", which
       yields "ct".

   6.  Concatenate "response_nonce" and "ct", yielding an Encapsulated
       Response "enc_response".  Note that "response_nonce" is of fixed-
       length, so there is no ambiguity in parsing either
       "response_nonce" or "ct".

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

   secret = context.Export("secret", Nk)
   response_nonce = random(Nk)
   salt = concat(enc, response_nonce)
   prk = Extract(salt, secret)
   aead_key = Expand(secret, "key", Nk)
   aead_nonce = Expand(secret, "nonce", Nn)
   enc_reponse = Seal(aead_key, aead_nonce, "", response)

   Clients decrypt an Encapsulated Request by reversing this process.
   That is, they first parse "enc_response" into "response_nonce" and
   "ct".  They then follow the same process to derive values for
   "aead_key" and "aead_nonce".  Finally, the client decrypts "ct" using
   the Open function provided by the AEAD.  Decrypting might produce an
   error, as shown.

   reponse, error = Open(key, nonce, aad, enc_response)
