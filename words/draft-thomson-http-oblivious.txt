1.  Introduction

   The act of making a request using HTTP reveals information about the
   client identity to a server.  Though the content of requests might
   reveal information, that is information under the control of the
   client.  In comparison, the source address on the connection reveals
   information that a client has only limited control over.

   Even where an IP address is not directly attributed to an individual,
   the use of an address over time can be used to correlate requests.
   Servers are able to use this information to assemble profiles of
   client behavior, from which they can make inferences about the people
   involved.  The use of persistent connections to make multiple
   requests improves performance, but provides servers with additional
   certainty about the identity of clients in a similar fashion.

   Use of an HTTP proxy can provide a degree of protection against
   servers correlating requests.  Systems like virtual private networks
   or the Tor network [Dingledine2004], provide other options for
   clients.

   Though the overhead imposed by these methods varies, the cost for
   each request is significant.  In order to prevent linking requests to
   the same client, each request requires a completely new TLS
   connection to the server.  At a minimum, this requires an additional
   round trip to the server in addition to that required by the request.
   In addition to having high latency, there are significant secondary
   costs, both in terms of the number of additional bytes exchanged and
   the CPU cost of cryptographic computations.

   This document describes a method of encapsulation for binary HTTP
   messages [BINARY] using Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE; [HPKE]).
   This protects the content of both requests and responses and enables
   a deployment architecture that can separate the identity of a
   requester from the request.

   Though this scheme requires that servers and proxies explicitly
   support it, this design represents a performance improvement over
   options that perform just one request in each connection.  With
   limited trust placed in the proxy (see Section 5), clients are
   assured that requests are not uniquely attributed to them or linked
   to other requests.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

   Encapsulated Request:  An HTTP request that is encapsulated in an
      HPKE-encrypted message; see Section 4.1.

   Encapsulated Response:  An HTTP response that is encapsulated in an
      HPKE-encrypted message; see Section 4.2.

   Oblivious Proxy Resource:  An intermediary that forwards requests and
      responses between clients and a single oblivious request resource.

   Oblivious Request Resource:  A resource that can receive an
      encapsulated request, extract the contents of that request,
      forward it to an oblivious target resource, receive a response,
      encapsulate that response, then return that response.

   Oblivious Target Resource:  The resource that is the target of an
      encapsulated request.  This resource logically handles only
      regular HTTP requests and responses and so might be ignorant of
      the use of oblivious HTTP to reach it.

3.  Overview

   A client learns the following:

   *  The identity of an oblivious request resource.  This might include
      some information about oblivious target resources that the
      oblivious request resource supports.

   *  The details of an HPKE public key that the oblivious request
      resource accepts, including an identifier for that key and the
      HPKE algorithms that are used with that key.

   *  The identity of an oblivious proxy resource that will forward
      encapsulated requests and responses to the oblivious request
      resource.

   This information allows the client to make a request of an oblivious
   target resource without that resource having only a limited ability
   to correlate that request with the client IP or other requests that
   the client might make to that server.

                    Figure 1: Overview of Oblivious HTTP

   In order to make a request to an oblivious target resource, the
   following steps occur, as shown in Figure 1:

   1.   The client constructs an HTTP request for an oblivious target
        resource.

   2.   The client encodes the HTTP request in a binary HTTP message and
        then encapsulates that message using HPKE and the process from
        Section 4.1.

   3.   The client sends a POST request to the oblivious proxy resource
        with the encapsulated request as the content of that message.

   4.   The oblivious proxy resource forwards this request to the
        oblivious request resource.

   5.   The oblivious request resource receives this request and removes
        the HPKE protection to obtain an HTTP request.

   6.   The oblivious request resource makes an HTTP request that
        includes the target URI, method, fields, and content of the
        request it acquires.

   7.   The oblivious target resource answers this HTTP request with an
        HTTP response.

   8.   The oblivious request resource encapsulates the HTTP response
        following the process in Section 4.2 and sends this in response
        to the request from the oblivious proxy resource.

   9.   The oblivious proxy resource forwards this response to the
        client.

   10.  The client removes the encapsulation to obtain the response to
        the original request.

4.  HPKE Encapsulation

   HTTP message encapsulation uses HPKE for request and response
   encryption.  An encapsulated HTTP message includes the following
   values:

   1.  A binary-encoded HTTP message [CITEME].

   2.  Padding of arbitrary length which MUST contain all zeroes.

   The encoding of an HTTP message is as follows:

   Plaintext Message {
     Message Length (i),
     Message (..),
     Padding Length (i),
     Padding (..),
   }

   This structure is then encrypted under a key with a specific
   identity, forming an encapsulated HTTP message, with the following
   structure:

   Key Identifer {
     Key ID Length (i),
     Key ID (..),
   }

   Encapsulated Message {
     Key Identifier (..)
     Encrypted Message Length (i),
     Encrypted Message (..),
   }

   The encapsulated message Key ID, as well as the encryption mechanics,
   are different for requests and responses, as described below.

4.1.  HPKE Encapsulation of Requests

   Clients encapsulate a request Plaintext Message "msg" with an HPKE
   public key "pkR", whose Key Identifier is "keyID" as follows:

   1.  Compute an HPKE context using "pkR", yielding "context" and
       encapsulation key "enc"

   2.  Encrypt (seal) "msg" with "keyID" as associated data using
       "context", yielding ciphertext "ct"

   3.  Concatenate "enc" and "ct", yielding an Encrypted Message
       "encrypted_msg"

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

   enc, context = SetupBaseS(pkR, "request")
   aad = 0x01 || keyID
   encrypted_msg = context.Seal(aad, msg)

   Clients construct the Encapsulated Message "req" using "keyID" and
   "encrypted_msg".

   Servers decrypt an Encapsulated Message by reversing this process.
   Given an Encapsulated Message "req" request with Key Identifier
   "keyID" corresponding to an existing HPKE private key "skR", servers
   decapsulate the Message as follows:

   1.  Parse the "req" Encrypted Message as the concatenation of "enc"
       and "encrypted_message"

   2.  Compute an HPKE context using "skR" and the encapsulated key
       "enc" from "req", yielding "context"

   3.  Decrypt "encrypted_message" with "keyID" as associated data,
       yielding "msg" or an error on failure

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

   context = SetupBaseR(enc, skR, "request")
   aad = 0x01 || keyID
   msg, error = context.Open(aad, ct)

   Servers MUST verify that the Plaintext Message padding consists of
   all zeroes before processing the corresponding Message.

4.2.  HPKE Encapsulation of Responses

   Given an HPKE context "context" and a response Plaintext Message
   "resp" sent in response to a Plaintext Message "req", servers encrypt
   the data as follows:

   1.  Derive a symmetric key and nonce from "context"

   2.  Encrypt "resp" with empty Key Identifier "emptyKeyID" as
       associated data, yielding "encrypted_msg"

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

   secret = context.Export("secret", 32)
   prk = Extract(req, secret)
   key = Expand(secret, "key", Nk)
   nonce = Expand(secret, "nonce", Nn)
   aad = 0x02 || emptyKeyID
   encrypted_msg = Seal(key, nonce, aad, resp)

   Extract and Expand are functions corresponding to the HPKE context's
   KDF algorithm, and Seal, Nk, and Nn correspond to the HPKE context's
   AEAD algorithm.

   Clients decrypt an Encapsulated Message by reversing this process.
   Namely, they derive the necessary AEAD parameters from an existing
   HPKE context and then decrypt (open) the Encapsulated Message
   encrypted message.

4.3.  Padding

   Plaintext Messages support arbitrary length padding.  Clients and
   servers MAY pad HTTP messages as needed to hide metadata leakage
   through ciphertext length.

5.  Responsibility of Roles

   In this design, a client wishes to make a request of a server that is
   authoritative for the oblivious target resource.  The client wishes
   to make this request without linking that request with either:

   1.  The identity at the network and transport layer of the client
       (that is, the client IP address and TCP or UDP port number the
       client uses to create a connection).

   2.  Any other request the client might have made in the past or might
       make in the future.

   In order to ensure this, the client selects a proxy (that serves the
   oblivious proxy resource) that it trusts will protect this
   information by forwarding the encapsulated request and response
   without passing the server (that serves the oblivious request
   resource).

   In this section, a deployment where there are three entities is
   considered:

   *  A client makes requests and receives responses

   *  A proxy operates the oblivious proxy resource

   *  A server operates both the oblivious request resource and the
      oblivious target resource

   To achieve the stated privacy goals, the oblivious proxy resource
   cannot be operated by the same entity as the oblivious request
   resource.  However, colocation of the oblivious request resource and
   oblivious target resource simplifies the interactions between those
   resources without affecting client privacy.

5.1.  Client

   Clients have the fewest direct responsibilities, though clients do
   need to ensure that they do not undermine the process.

   Clients cannot carry connection-level state between requests as they
   only establish direct connections to the proxy responsible for the
   oblivious proxy resource.  However, clients need to ensure that they
   construct requests without any information gained from previous
   requests.  Otherwise, the server might be able to use that
   information to link requests.  Cookies [COOKIES] are the most obvious
   feature that MUST NOT be used by clients.  However, clients need to
   include all information learned from requests, which could include
   the identity of resources.

   Clients also need to ensure that they correctly generate a new HPKE
   context for every request, using a good source of entropy ([RANDOM]).
   Key reuse not only risks linkability, but it could expose request and
   response contents to the proxy.  Note that an HPKE implementation is
   stateful and so prevents AEAD nonce reuse.

   Clients constructing the request that is to be encapsulated need to
   avoid including identifying information.  Similarly, the request that
   is sent to the oblivious request resource, though this request can
   contain only minimal information as it only needs to include a method
   and the oblivious request resource URL.

5.2.  Proxy Responsibilities

   The proxy that serves the oblivious proxy resource has a very simple
   function to perform.  It forwards messages received at this resource
   to the oblivious request resource.

   The proxy MUST NOT add information about the client identity when
   forwarding requests.  This includes the Via field, the Forwarded
   field [FORWARDED], and any similar information.

5.2.1.  Denial of Service

   As there are privacy benefits from having a large rate of requests
   forwarded by the same proxy (see Section 5.2.2), servers that operate
   the oblivious request resource might need an arrangement with
   proxies.  This arrangement might be necessary to prevent having the
   large volume of requests being classified as an attack by the server.

   If a server does accept a large volume of requests from a proxy, it
   needs to trust that the proxy does not allow abusive levels of
   request volumes from clients.  That is, if a server allows requests
   from the proxy to be exempt from rate limits, the server might want
   to ensure that the proxy applies similar rate limiting when receiving
   requests from clients.

   Servers that enter into an agreement with a proxy that enables a
   higher request rate might choose to authenticate the proxy to enable
   the higher rate.

5.2.2.  Linkability Through Traffic Analysis

   As the time at which encapsulated request or response messages are
   sent can reveal information to a network observer.  Though messages
   exchanged between the oblivious proxy resource and the oblivious
   request resource might be sent in a single connection, traffic
   analysis could be used to match messages that are forwarded by the
   proxy.

   A proxy could, as part of its function, add delays in order to
   increase the anonymity set into which each message is attributed.
   This could latency to the overall time clients take to receive a
   response, which might not what some clients want.

   A proxy can use padding to reduce the effectiveness of traffic
   analysis.

   A proxy that forwards large volumes of exchanges can provide better
   privacy by providing larger sets of messages that need to be matched.

   What steps a proxy takes to mitigate the risk of traffic analysis is
   something a client needs to consider when selecting a proxy.

5.3.  Server Responsibilities

   A server that operates both oblivious request and oblivious target
   resources is responsible for removing request encapsulation,
   generating a response the encapsulated request, and encapsulating the
   response.

   A server needs to ensure that the encapsulated responses it sends are
   padded to protect against traffic analysis; see Section 5.2.2.

   If separate entities provide the oblivious request resource and
   oblivious target resource, these entities might need an arrangement
   similar to that between server and proxy for managing denial of
   service; see Section 5.2.1.  It is also necessary to provide
   confidentiality protection for the unprotected requests and
   responses, plus protections for traffic analysis; see Section 5.2.2.
